""" The inputs in this test were created on purpose to make it easy, my program output was:

Loop starts at 2 and has period of 16579, ending in [16579]
Loop starts at 4 and has period of 18827, ending in [18827]
Loop starts at 3 and has period of 19951, ending in [19951]
Loop starts at 2 and has period of 12083, ending in [12083]
Loop starts at 2 and has period of 22199, ending in [22199]
Loop starts at 2 and has period of 17141, ending in [17141]

- The first loop finds the end at 16579, and repeats every 16579. So it will find an end at every multiple of 16579
- Same with all of the loops

Therefore, the first time they all collide at an end, it will be in the least common multiple of them all, 16342438708751
